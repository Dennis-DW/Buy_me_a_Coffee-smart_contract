# Sample Hardhat Project
The provided Solidity smart contract, named "BuyMeACoffee," allows users to send Ether as tips along with a message to the contract owner (Dennis) and stores these tips in the contract. The contract owner can later withdraw the ether.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
